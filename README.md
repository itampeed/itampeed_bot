# Quiz Bot Telegram Bot

Welcome to the Quiz Bot Telegram Bot project! This bot allows users to participate in a quiz by answering a series of questions. The bot presents questions to the user, validates their answers, and provides a final quiz result upon completion.

## Getting Started

To use this bot, you'll need to set up a Telegram bot using the Telegram Bot API and configure a MySQL database for storing quiz questions and user data.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

1. **Telegram Bot Token**: Create a new bot on Telegram and obtain the bot token. You can create a new bot by talking to the [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) on Telegram.

2. **Python and Dependencies**: This bot is written in Python and uses the `python-telegram-bot` library for interacting with the Telegram Bot API. Install the required dependencies using:

   ```bash
   pip install python-telegram-bot mysql-connector-python
   ```

3. **MySQL Database**: You need a MySQL database to store quiz questions. Make sure you have MySQL installed and accessible on your computer.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-telegram-bot.git
   cd quiz-telegram-bot
   ```

2. Create a MySQL database and import the quiz questions:

   - Use the provided SQL script (`quiz_app.sql`) to create the required tables and populate them with quiz questions.

3. Update the bot token and database configuration in your code:

   - Open `main.py` and replace the placeholders with your Telegram bot token and MySQL database connection details.

4. Run the bot:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Start a chat with your bot on Telegram.
2. Send the `/start` command to the bot to begin the quiz.
3. The bot will present questions and options. Reply with the number (1-4) corresponding to your answer.
4. The bot will provide feedback on whether your answer is correct or not.
5. After completing the quiz, the bot will display your quiz result.
